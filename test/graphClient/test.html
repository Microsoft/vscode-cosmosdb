        This file is the easiest way to debug code in the graph client, or to be able to inspect
        the HTML/CSS.
        Run the CosmosDB extension under the debugger, note the
        port number specified in the output window, modify the below address to use that
        number, then load test.html in an external browser.

        In vscode, if you switch tabs away from a graph view and back to it, all of the client code, HTML
        and CSS will be immediately reloaded, so much testing can also be done that way.
